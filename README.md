To get started on using my app you will have to clone this repository with https 'https://github.com/pledgedavis/Rails-app.git' and run "git clone" in front of that link in your local environments terminal. Then you will also have to run "bundle update" in your terminal to download all gems and dependencies. Lastly you will then be able to run "rails s" to startup the local server that holds my project. Make sure when running rails s that the url in the browser is "http://localhost:3000/" to navigate to the welcome page and then feel free to login or sign up to an existing user.
